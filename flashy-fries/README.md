# Study Date

- Have you ever heard "You can't pay attention to your studies if you are _dating_ someone." in your brown household?

  > Uss ladki (/ladke) ne teri padhai mein naiyya paar nahi karvani.

- Have you ever missed (read: _bunked_) your tuitions or coaching to go on a date with someone?
- Do you struggle balancing studies with dating?

With our oxymoronic [Study Date™](https://study-date-eda7b.web.app/), we help you get the best of **both** worlds! Study Date™ is Flashy-Fries' attempt at **combining** studying and online dating; both of which are widely considered to have an **opposite** dynamic to each other.

## How to use Study Date?

This is how Study Date™ works:

- Visit the Study Date™ website and create an account on it for free. You are given the option to register either as a **student** or as a **teacher**.

- After getting logged in, visit the dashboard to see the **list of topics** available.

- Choose the topic you want to study with or teach a random online date.
- You can either choose to study with a student (Study Date™) or a teacher. (To be implemented)
- Our backend matches you with someone who wants to study the same topic and initiates a video call for you with them.

- After you are done studying on video call, you can obtain your reward (cute dog & cat photos) for completing the Study Date™. (To be implemented)

We have used the widely hated and ridiculed Comic Sans MS font for _designing_ our logo, because why not, since we are _combining opposites_. :smiley:
